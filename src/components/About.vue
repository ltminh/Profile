      <p>
        I'm a senior developer with a Bachelor of Science (B.S) in Software Engineering from University of Information Technology and more than 5 years of software development experience.

I'm quite versatile. I can work on mobile stuffs, both native and cross-platform (using Xamarin). When I need something centralized, I'll roll into backend API service using either ASP.NET for Windows stack or Node.js, Python for Unix stack. In my spare time, I'm playing around with ETL, data scraping or doing machine learning stuffs.
